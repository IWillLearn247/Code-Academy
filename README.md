# Code-Academy - HTML
This is all my learning in Code Academy<br>
-HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.<br>
-Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them. <br>
-HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.<br>
-Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing body tags.<br>
-Headings and sub-headings, h1 to h6 tags, are used to provide titles for sections of content.<br>
p, span and div tags specify text or blocks.<br>
-The em and strong tags are used to emphasize text.<br>
-Line breaks are created with the br tag.<br>
-Ordered lists ol are numbered and unordered lists ul are bulleted.<br>
-Images img and videos video can be added by linking to an existing source.<br>
-The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect. <br>
-The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.<br>
-Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.<br>
-You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.<br>
-A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.<br>
-Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.<br>
-You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.<br>
-Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.<br>
-Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.<br>
-Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.<br>
 
 # Code-Academy - CSS
-The basic anatomy of CSS syntax written for both inline styles and stylesheets.<br>
-Some commonly used CSS terms, such as ruleset, selector, and declaration.<br>
-CSS inline styles can be written inside the opening HTML tag using the style attribute.<br>
-Inline styles can be used to style HTML, but it is not the best practice.<br>
-An internal stylesheet is written using the <style> element inside the <head> element of an HTML file.<br>
-Internal stylesheets can be used to style HTML but are also not best practice.<br>
-An external stylesheet separates CSS code from HTML, by using the .css file extension.<br>
-External stylesheets are the best approach when it comes to using HTML and CSS.<br>
-External stylesheets are linked to HTML using the <link> element.<br>

 # Code-Academy - Selectors
 CSS can select HTML elements by type, class, ID, and attribute.<br>
All elements can be selected using the universal selector.<br>
An element can have different states using the pseudo-class selector.<br>
Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.<br>
Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.<br>
IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than type. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a type selector.<br>
Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity but can be necessary.<br>
Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.<br>
Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.<br>
 
 # Code-Academy Padding
The box model comprises a set of properties used to create space around and between HTML elements.<br>
The height and width of a content area can be set in pixels or percentages.<br>
Borders surround the content area and padding of an element. The color, style, and thickness of a border can be set with CSS properties.<br>
Padding is the space between the content area and the border. It can be set in pixels or percent.<br>
Margin is the amount of spacing outside of an element’s border.<br>
Horizontal margins add, so the total space between the borders of adjacent elements is equal to the sum of the right margin of one element and the left margin of the adjacent element.<br>
Vertical margins collapse, so the space between vertically adjacent elements is equal to the larger margi<br>n.<br>
margin: 0 auto horizontally centers an element inside of its parent content area, if it has a width.<br>
The overflow property can be set to display, hide, or scroll, and dictates how HTML will render content that overflows its parent’s content area.<br>
The visibility property can hide or show elements.<br>
