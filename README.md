# Code-Academy - HTML
This is all my learning in Code Academy<br>
-HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.<br>
-Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them. <br>
-HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.<br>
-Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing body tags.<br>
-Headings and sub-headings, h1 to h6 tags, are used to provide titles for sections of content.<br>
p, span and div tags specify text or blocks.<br>
-The em and strong tags are used to emphasize text.<br>
-Line breaks are created with the br tag.<br>
-Ordered lists ol are numbered and unordered lists ul are bulleted.<br>
-Images img and videos video can be added by linking to an existing source.<br>
-The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect. <br>
-The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.<br>
-Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.<br>
-You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.<br>
-A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.<br>
-Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.<br>
-You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.<br>
-Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.<br>
-Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.<br>
-Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.<br>
 
 # Code-Academy - CSS
-The basic anatomy of CSS syntax written for both inline styles and stylesheets.<br>
-Some commonly used CSS terms, such as ruleset, selector, and declaration.<br>
-CSS inline styles can be written inside the opening HTML tag using the style attribute.<br>
-Inline styles can be used to style HTML, but it is not the best practice.<br>
-An internal stylesheet is written using the <style> element inside the <head> element of an HTML file.<br>
-Internal stylesheets can be used to style HTML but are also not best practice.<br>
-An external stylesheet separates CSS code from HTML, by using the .css file extension.<br>
-External stylesheets are the best approach when it comes to using HTML and CSS.<br>
-External stylesheets are linked to HTML using the <link> element.<br>
