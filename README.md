-HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.<br>
-Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them. <br>
-HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.<br>
-Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing body tags.<br>
